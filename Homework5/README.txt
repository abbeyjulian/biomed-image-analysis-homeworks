The mAP reported here is essentially 0; the network did not detect hardly any objects correctly. I believe this is because I should have used the configuration files specifically for voc and possibly for YOLOv2 because v3 does not have a voc configuration file for the tiny version. Unfortunately, it took all weekend (48+ hours) to run the network predictions on my CPU, and as of 8:45pm Monday I am still waiting for the network to upload to Google Colab in order to try and run the predictions again on the GPU; I am not confident that this will happen before midnight. I should have used the voc specific configuration files, and I should have initially loaded the data and network into the GPU for faster predictions. However, I do think otherwise my set-up and mAP calculations are correct.
